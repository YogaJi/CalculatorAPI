# CalculatorAPI

 A Calculator API that can add, sbutract, multiple, and divide.<br>
 
 the API include a basic terminal and another html input method.<br>
 
 The Asp.Net Core Web App is an example to applying the API on a website.<br>
 
 The form structure in the html can force user input as a number (>0.0000).<br>
 
 In terminal, I use a static function to check user input to process calculations.<br>
 
 # How to operate
